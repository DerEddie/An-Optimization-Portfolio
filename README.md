# Operations Research Projects (Check for Overview)

This is a portfolio on all the projects I completed during my studies at TU Kaiserslautern. The smaller projects I started on my own, in order to get familiar with other solvers like gurobi and MiniZinc.

MiniZinc [Study notes](https://github.com/DerEddie/An-Optimization-Portfolio-Decision-Science/blob/main/MiniZincSolver/Description.md)
I am working on this course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-modeling/home/welcome

This Portfolio will cover some examples of problems

What solvers are out there which one could use to solve an optimization problem?

Tools to build decision support systems:
- GAMS
- Gurobi
- MiniZinc
- OR-Tools (Google)
- ZIMPL
