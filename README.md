# An-Optimization-Portfolio
This Portfolio will cover some examples of problems

What solvers are out there which one could use to solve an optimization problem?

Tools to build decision support systems:
- GAMS
- Gurobi
- MiniZinc
- OR-Tools (Google)


D(X), D(Y)


X ∈ D(X) , Y ∈ D(Y)
|X| + |Y| = 10


Problem:
Find the largest D'(x) ⊆ D(X) and D'(Y) ⊆ D(Y)
X ∈ D'(X), Y ∈ D'(Y)
