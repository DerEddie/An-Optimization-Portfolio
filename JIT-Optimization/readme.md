This work is about an integrated machine scheduling and vehicle routing problem which
could be applied in a just-in-time production environment. The problem can be decomposed into two subproblems. The first one being a parallel machine scheduling problem
with machine ready times and job dependant processing times. The second subproblem
focuses on the delivery of jobs by a vehicle fleet while considering delivery time windows
and service times.

A matheuristic was developed to solve the problem.
