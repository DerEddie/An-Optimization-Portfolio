Crossdocking is an important operation in logistics


I visited this cross-dock in Bornheim [Rhineland-Palatinate] of a retail company:

Crossdocks are essential for receiving ordered goods. Arriving goods have to go to check for quality. Furhermore, goods might be stored for a longer period (classical warehousing) or a fragmentation has to be performed and a transhipment onto other trucks takes places (cross-docking). 

Advantages of cross-docking are:
- less space utilization because goods are only temporary staying in the cross-dock and are loaded ASAP onto outbound trucks.

A lot of interesting decisions have to be made when operating a cross-dock:
- How many workers do we need on a workshift?
- Can we make cross-docking more efficient when we assign arriving trucks to specific docks?
